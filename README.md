# AI-Fire-Detection-System 🔥🤖

A deep learning solution for detecting fire in images, designed to enhance traditional fire detection methods.

---

## Overview 📝

This system leverages modern deep learning and image processing techniques to detect fires in images. It serves as a supplementary tool, adding an extra layer of security to conventional fire detection systems.

---

## Technical Details 🛠️

The project is built using:
- **Python**
- **Keras**
- **TensorFlow**
- **OpenCV**

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a dataset comprising images categorized into two classes: fire and no-fire.

## Repository Structure 📂

- `train.py`: Prepares the image data, constructs and trains the CNN model, then saves the trained model.
- `predict.py`: Loads the trained model and predicts if a given image signifies a fire.
